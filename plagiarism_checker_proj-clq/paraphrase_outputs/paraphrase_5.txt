Plagiarism detection is an essential concern in the education field, particularly in academic writing. Schools require fair methods to verify work so that students are assessed on their own ideas rather than copied content. Most contemporary detection tools primarily depend on word-level text matching, which works for direct copying but often misses paraphrased or rewritten text. With the widespread adoption of AI-based writing and paraphrasing tools, traditional plagiarism detection methods that rely on surface-level text matching are becoming insufficient, as rephrased content can easily evade them. Therefore, it is essential to develop systems that can identify semantic similarity between texts, as they can recognize when texts communicate the same ideas. Such an approach can catch plagiarism more accurately and help uphold academic integrity.
