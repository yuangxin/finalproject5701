Plagiarism detection is a crucial concern in the education sector, especially within academic writing. Educational institutions require fair methods to evaluate work, ensuring students are assessed based on their own ideas rather than copied content. Most existing detection tools primarily depend on word-level text matching, which is effective for direct copying but often fails with paraphrased or rewritten text. With the growing use of AI-based writing and paraphrasing tools, traditional plagiarism detection techniques that focus on surface-level text matching are becoming inadequate, as rephrased content can easily elude them. Thus, it's essential to develop systems capable of identifying semantic similarity between texts, as they can detect when texts convey the same ideas. This approach can more accurately identify plagiarism and help uphold academic integrity.
