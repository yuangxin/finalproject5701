Detecting plagiarism is a major concern in education, specifically in academic writing. Educational institutions need fair ways to evaluate work to ensure students are judged on their original ideas rather than borrowed content. Most current detection tools rely on word-level text matching, which is effective for direct copies but often fails with paraphrased or rewritten content. With the increasing use of AI-based writing and paraphrasing tools, traditional plagiarism detection methods that focus on superficial text matching are becoming inadequate, as rephrased content can easily bypass them. Thus, developing systems that can identify semantic similarities between texts is crucial, as they can detect when texts communicate the same ideas. This approach can more accurately catch plagiarism and help preserve academic integrity.
