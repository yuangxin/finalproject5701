In the realm of education, particularly in academic writing, plagiarism detection is a significant issue. Schools need equitable methods to assess work, ensuring students are evaluated based on their original ideas rather than copied content. Most contemporary detection tools rely on word-level text matching, which is effective for direct copying but often misses paraphrased or rewritten text. As AI-based writing and paraphrasing tools become more prevalent, traditional plagiarism detection methods, which depend on superficial text matching, are proving inadequate since rephrased content can easily evade them. Therefore, it is necessary to develop systems that can identify semantic similarities between texts, as they can recognize when texts express the same ideas. Such an approach can more accurately capture plagiarism and help maintain academic integrity.
