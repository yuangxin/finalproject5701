Plagiarism detection is a vital issue in education, especially in academic writing. Schools need fair mechanisms to assess work, ensuring students are evaluated based on their own ideas rather than copied content. Most current detection tools rely on word-level matching, which works well for direct copying but often fails with paraphrased or rewritten text. As AI-based writing and paraphrasing tools become more widespread, traditional plagiarism detection methods that rely on surface-level text matching are becoming insufficient, as rephrased content can easily bypass them. Therefore, developing systems capable of identifying semantic similarities between texts is necessary, as they can recognize when texts convey the same ideas. Such an approach can more accurately detect plagiarism and support academic integrity.
